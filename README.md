About
-

**Ted, The Frog** is a simple sidescroller endless runner game created for the GameJaaj3 game jam, but wasn't finished in time, so we decided to polish it a little more and release it anyways.

Instructions
-

Be fast, don't let the time run out and don't be eaten by the aligators!

To play, use the left mouse button for short jump, right mouse jump for long jump. Get the flies for points, and the clocks for more time.
